# clj-fitbit-public

A Clojure library designed to access the public Fitbit API. The public API is what you can see using consumer_key only OAuth.

## Usage

Add the dependency to your project:

    [clj-fitbit-public "0.1.0"]

require it

    > (require '[fitbit-public.client :as fitbit])

Each endpoint is a separate function, you need to call the function with at least your OAuth consumer-key, consumer-secret of your [registered app][1] and the user-id of the profile you want to look at. Some also require a date or date range.

    > (def api-key {:consumer-key "..." :consumer-secret "..."})
    > (fitbit/profile api-key "<user-id>")
    {"user" { ... }}

## Implemented API

Dates and the base-dates should be of the format "yyyy-MM-dd". A period for the Date-range based ones is either a date to specify the end date or a time period to specify the length of the window (e.g. 1d, 7d, 1w, 3m, 1y, max).
